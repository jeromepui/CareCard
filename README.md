# CareCard

CareCard is a provider-sourced data aggregator that gives care providers a holistic view of senior care. We provide a simple way for senior care providers to share and access non-medical care information.

This project was built for [Build for Good 2024](https://www.build.gov.sg/bfg2024/), a citizen engagement initiative by [Open Government Products](https://www.open.gov.sg/) that aims to empower citizens to make Singapore better in their own ways.
